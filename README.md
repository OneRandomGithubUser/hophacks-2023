# Hophacks-2023 Project: Hedgy Med Caddy
Household-centered platform for chronic disease medication management. Making it easier for family members of all ages to participate and share the burden while also having a bit of fun!

home.html is the main file and will have prompts that guides the user through the pages. 
Circle_Generator.py is where we used skimage to do image recognition of pills from pictures.
